- **Capstone Project : ZED Travel Planner** </br>
  Worked with my STEP pod to create a smart travel planner that allows users to create a trip itinerary and manage events, flights, and hotels. It also suggests places for users to visit (activities or food), and can optimize their schedule to minimze travel time. </br>
